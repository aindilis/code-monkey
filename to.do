(We would  like to have  automated techniques for  detecting antiquated
 programming techniques and automatically fixing them.)

(Also add techniques for taking a perl script and making it into an OO
 perl application)

(Code monkey  can recognize when a given  refactorization involves the
 totality of  a libraries involvement, and  if it is  no longer needed,
 remove it.  Hence, look to  refactorization of OO-perl as a major part
 of code monkey)

(Also, need to study now, how to get Free Java working, as it probably
 pretty useful.  Don't use it of course, until we map out the licensing
 of  the  various   tools.   In  other  words,  when   scouting  out  a
 technological  direction,  must analyze  the  licenses  as a  critical
 factor in IPB.)

(
 Decided to turn code monkey into my general purpose AI for now.  The
 notion is that the system is equipped with a classifier/learner, etc,
 so it can "know" what type of object it is "looking at", and from this
 and its decision base, decide what kind of actions to take.  In
 rereading this very paragraph, I realize this must have been the
 inspiration for the now Sayer/Thinker systems, which are much further
 along, but have a ways to go.
