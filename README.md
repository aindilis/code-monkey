Code Monkey

A million apes pounding away at keys long enough will eventually write
Hamlet.

As a sign of the progress of our systems, we now have more or less a
need for an "automated programmer" (or Debian maintainer).  This is
because, much in the same way that CMU's gaze estimator builds on
their stable platform for Active Appearance Models which accurately
model head position, we now have a large architecture for manipulating
and working on packages.  This allows us to mount a "code-monkey",
i.e. gives us the setting in which to develop tools which can be
applied to improving what already exists in terms of automated methods
for dealing with code.  Therefore the code-monkey system is
appropriate.  It fits in naturally with the existing hierarchy - radar
predator architect boss (code-monkey).
